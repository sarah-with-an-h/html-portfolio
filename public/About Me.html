<p>Future full stack web developer, creative powerhouse, gym rat, and valedictorian of the Derek Zoolander Center for Kids Who Can’t Read Good and Wanna Learn to Do Other Stuff Good Too. On a mission of caffeine-fueled world domination, one clean line of code at a time.</p>

<p>Mom to an amazing son, one of nine siblings (I’m built for collaboration, chaos and compromise), and rescue mom to Bubbas, a 70lb Pitbull lapdog. </p>

<p>When I’m not building websites, you’ll find me sketching, listening to music, lifting heavy things at the gym, lost in a book I swore I’d read “just one more chapter” of, soaking up the sun at the beach, or deep in a podcast rabbit hole. I’m fluent in HTML, JavaScript, and sarcasm.</p>
